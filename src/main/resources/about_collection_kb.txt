<h1>About the collection</h1>
<h2> General Information </h2>
<p>
The Danish Netarchive is responsible for collecting and preserving the Danish part of the Internet as part of the Danish Legal Deposit Act.
Our goal is to ensure the material can be used for future research purposes.
</p>

<p>
Our collection has been collected through four primary strategies for collecting.  
</p>
<br>
<h4>Harvest strategy</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>Cross-sectional collection which takes a snapshot of all Danish domains up to four times a year</li>
  <li>Selective collection from the following types of websites: all Danish news media (ranging from 12 times daily to weekly), political parties, organisations and associations, ministries and agencies, selected profiles from social media, YouTube videos (for example weekly)</li>
  <li>Event collection of two or three events annually (for example parliamentary elections or the Corona pandemic)</li>
  <li>Special collections for example based on research requests</li>
</ul> 
<br>
<p>
The amount of material in the archive is constantly growing. At the beginning of 2022, it contained approximately 850 TB and over 34 billion objects.
The collected material can only be used for research purposes because it contains sensitive personal information.
When working with the web archive it is important to be aware of flaws and misrepresentations in the collection.
In the following section we are describing and presenting known flaws in our archive.
</p> <br>

<h2>Harvest year XXXX</h2>
<p>
When examining the size of the archive on a yearly basis it seems like there is an extraordinary dip in amount af data in year XXXX.
In fact, this is not a loss of data or the result of a narrow harvest. Instead it is a result af a compression of the harvested data.
So even though the collection from this year seems smaller messured on size in bytes, it is in fact bigger than the year before messured in numbers of pages harvested.

<h2>dr.dk</h2>
dr.dk is the domain for the national broadcasting service in Denmark. Our harvests from dr.dk are reliable in size and content.
