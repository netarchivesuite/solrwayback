<h1>Search syntax guideline for searching in the netarchive</h1>

<h3> Boolean Operators </h3>
The following 3 boolean operators are supported. They MUST be entered in uppercase or they will be considered normal search words. 
<table border='1'>
<tr>
<td> Operator </td>
<td> Example </td>
<td> Description </td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>AND</td>
 <td><b>computer AND apple</b></td>
 <td> Both terms must match. <br> Same as just: computer apple <br> AND is the default operator between terms if not specified</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>OR</td>
 <td><b>computer OR apple</b></td>
 <td>Will match if just any of the terms is found</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>NOT</td>
 <td><b>computer NOT apple</b></td>
 <td>Must match computer but not apple.<br> Alternative syntax: <b>computer -apple</b> </td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Use brackets if mixing operators</h3>
To avoid ambiguous interpretation of syntax always use brackets () if mixing operators.<br>
Example:<b> (computer AND apple) OR (amiga)<br> </b>
This can also return results where only the text 'amiga' is found.

<h3>Use fields to limit results considerably</h3>
If you only want results for a given domain etc. you can define this is the query. Here are some examples: <br>
<b>domain:testdomain.dk computer apple</b> (Same as domain:testdomain.dk AND computer AND apple)<br>
<b>source_file_path:"/mount/files/test123.warc"</b> (here quotes are required due to special character /). Will only show results from that warc-file.<br>
<b>domain:testdomain.dk AND crawl_year:2002 </b><br>	

<h3>Use quotes when required. This is called phrase search.</h3>
<b> "apple computer" </b> will only match if both words are next to each other in the the text.<br>
<b> "apple computer"~4</b> The tilde character ~ is a proximity clause and can be used to define how far the words must be found apart in the text. Can also be used for multiple words.<br>
<b> links:"http://mydomain.dk/mypage.html"</b> Find all html pages that links to this exact page. Due to the special character in the url, the field value must be in quotes.<br> 
Since all links are normalized and must be matched with the normalized url, you can use the url search feature to find the normalized form of any url.<br>


<h3>Wildcards</h3>
The character * and ? can be used as wilds cards in terms.<br>
Examples:<br>
<b>innovati*</b> will match all words that starts with this. ie. innovation or innovative<br>
<b> Analy?e </b> Wlll match both analyse and analyze and analyce etc. Multiple ? in a row can be used. Each ? will match exactly one character.<br>
The wild card ? has been used to find common spelling mistakes of words on the net.<br>
Warning: Do not use wildcards in the start of words (prefix) as this can take too long time to resolve. 

<h3>Range search</h3>
If the field value is numeric or date you can specify a range that must match.<br>
Examples:
<b>content_type_norm:image AND content_length:[1000000 TO 10000000]</b> Search only images of size 1Mb to 10Mb <br>
<b>crawl_date:[2010-01-01T00:00:00Z TO 2010-02-01T00:00:00Z]</b> Only search for resources that has been crawled in January 2010.<br>
The <b>TO</b> must be upper case and notice the Z in the end of the dates.  
 
 <h3>Default fields</h3>
 
 When searching without using field prefix you will only search the define default search fields. <br>
 These are the most obvious field for text search like content_text,title,url etc. but far from all fields. <br>
 The default search fields are also case insensitive, but for some fields case must also match. <br>
 Always use field prefix search if you also want to search a non-default search field.<br>
 Example: <b>content_type_served:"image/jpeg"</b>
