Our collection has been collected through four primary strategies for collecting.  
</p>
<br>
<h4>Harvest strategy example</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>Cross-sectional collection which takes a snapshot of all Danish domains up to four times a year</li>
  <li>Selective collection from the following types of websites: all Danish news media (ranging from 12 times daily to weekly), political parties, organisations and associations, ministries and agencies, selected profiles from social media, YouTube videos (for example weekly)</li>
  <li>Event collection of two or three events annually (for example parliamentary elections or the Corona pandemic)</li>
  <li>Special collections for example based on research requests</li>
</ul>
