# Solr availability and index change check interval: Every x seconds a query for new documents is issued.
# If an index change is detected, caches will be cleared
#
# The check is light (cached by Solr) if the index has not changed and moderate if the index has been
# changed. If the backing index has billions of records and is continuously updated, active checking
# will strain the system. In that case it is recommended to disable active checking and use fixed time
# cache clearing with solr.server.caching.age.seconds instead.
#
# Default is 60 seconds
# Disable by setting to -1
# If the checking is disabled, consider setting solr.server.caching.age.seconds instead
solr.server.check.interval.seconds=60

#Set to true to prevent SolrWayback url-hacking from accessing Warc-files+offset that is not in the Solr collection.

##ArcFileLocationResolverInterface implementation.
#Custom class implementation to map the index-time warc filepath (field source_file_path) to the filepath seen the solrwayback machine.  
#If not defined it will use the source_file_path as it is ( IdentityArcFileResolver)
#If WARC files has been moved instead of reindexing them again, you can provide the FileMovedMappingResolver.
#Only one warc.file.resolver class must be defined.

#parameters is full path to file with the new location of the WARC files (1 pr line)

#The possible values for url.normaliser are: normal, legacy and minimal.
# Only change the normaliser type if you know what you are doing.
# Only use minimal if the solr index was build in warc-indexer earlier that 3.0. All SolrWayback bundles have warc-indexer later than this. (Playback quality is drastically reduced)
# Use Legacy for 3.0-3.1 versions of the warc-indexer.
# Use normal for all warc-indexers version 3.2.0+
